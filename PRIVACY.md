# Privacy Policy for WakaTime for ShaderToy
*Last updated: September 5, 2025*

WakaTime for ShaderToy is an open-source browser extension created and maintained by a single developer. This extension is designed to track coding activity on [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com) using the [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) service or a server chosen by the user.

## Data Collection

* Total number of lines in the currently edited ShaderToy shader
* Current line number
* Current character number
* URL for saved shaders
* WakaTime project name (as set by you)

This data is **only collected if you configure the extension to track time for a given project**.

## Data Transmission
* All data is sent **only** to the server you specify (for example, WakaTime’s servers or your own self-hosted server).
* Data is authenticated using your personal WakaTime API key, which you provide in the extension’s settings.
* No data is sent to the extension developer or to any third-party servers beyond the one you select.

## Data Usage
The collected data is used exclusively for tracking coding activity and time spent on ShaderToy projects, as part of the WakaTime ecosystem.

The developer of this extension does not access, store, or process any of your data.

## Open Source
